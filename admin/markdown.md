Why hello there!
=============

Welcome to your brand new Minecraft Server, powered by [MinecraftServers.com](http://minecraftservers.com)!

We just wanted to take a moment to outline a few key things about your new server.

* For support and billing, go to <http://billing.hostiio.com>.
* This message is powered by [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), an easy to use text-to-HTML conversion tool and is changeable in the administrator panel of MCSAdmin. You can get there by clicking [here](admin/landing.php).
* This amazing Minecraft control panel you are about to enter has its underpinnings in [MineAdmin](http://github.com/robbiet480/MineAdmin). Thanks to them and open source awesomeness, we are able to give you a polished, custom control panel for controlling your Minecraft server.
* Finally, if you have any questions, comments or concerns, feel free to file a ticket in the portal and we will be more then happy to help you.

We hope you enjoy the many countless fun hours your new Minecraft Server will bring you!

Sincerely,

Robbie Trencheny (<robbie@hostiio.com>) and Dennis Tang (<dennis@hostiio.com>)
